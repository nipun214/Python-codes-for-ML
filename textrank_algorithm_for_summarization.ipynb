              "'Why hasn\\x92t Petra Kvitova done better at the US Open during her career?\\n\\n\\x93It\\x92s always pretty crowded,\\x94 the Czech told ESPN\\x92s Rennae Stubbs after her mostly impressive 6-4, 6-3 win over Jessica Pegula on Friday night. \\x93I like the peace and quiet.\\x94\\n\\nKvitova isn\\x92t shy, exactly, but she is easygoing and low-key. Most years, those are not words that anyone would use to describe the US Open. But 2020 is obviously not most years, and the grounds are definitely not crowded. If Kvitova wants peace and quiet, she can find a lot of it in the bubble.\\n\\nIs this, by itself, a reason to believe that Kvitova can make it past the quarterfinals in New York for the first time, and win the whole tournament? Probably not. But at 30, with six of the Top 10 absent, this would seem to be the year for her to make a push in New York. So far we\\x92ve talked a lot about Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, and Victoria Azarenka as potential contenders for the women\\x92s crown. Should we also be talking about Kvitova? She\\x92s one of the relatively few players in the draw with major titles to her name, and there aren\\x92t many who can stay with her power.Pegula, despite her scrappiest efforts, certainly couldn\\x92t. Kvitova, who at 6\\x920\\x94 has five inches on the American, set the tone by winning the first 10 points on her serve. While the match wasn\\x92t as one-sided as last night\\x92s blowout win by Felix Auger-Aliassime over Andy Murray, the dynamic was similar: One player was constantly attacking, and the other was constantly defending. Both times, the defender could never find a way to seize control of the points, and basically had to hope that the attacker missed.\\n\\nIn fairness, there\\x92s always reason to hope for that when you\\x92re facing Kvitova, whose game can veer from 10 to zero and back to 10 again multiple times during the course of a match, or even just a game. After winning the first set, Kvitova did have one of her lulls. But this time it only lasted two games; once she clicked back in, the match was out of Pegula\\x92s hands. Kvitova finished with 26 winners to just nine for the American, who would win just 35 percent of her second-serve points. There ends Pegula\\x92s summer run, which included a quarterfinal result at the Western & Southern Open and two wins at the US Open.\\n\\nHow far will Kvitova\\x92s run take her, in her bubble of peace and quiet? Unlike Pegula, her next two opponents, Shelby Rogers and possibly Naomi Osaka, will be better equipped to handle her power. Each also has a win over Kvitova at a major. But the Czech will be solidly favored to beat Rogers, and something close to even money against Osaka.\\n\\n\\x93I\\x92m so happy I decided to come her and play,\\x94 Kvitova said tonight.\\n\\nThese days, showing up may be half the battle.'"

Speaking at the Swiss Indoors tournament where he will play in Sunday\\x92s final against Romanian qualifier Marius Copil, the world number three said that given the impossibly short time frame to make a decision, he opted out of any commitment. \\x93They only left me three days to decide,\\x94 Federer said. \\x93I didn\\x92t to have time to consult with all the people I had to consult. \\x93I could not make a decision in that time, so I told them to do what they wanted.\\x94 The 20-time Grand Slam champion has voiced doubts about the wisdom of the one-week format to be introduced by organisers Kosmos, who have promised the International Tennis Federation up to $3 billion in prize money over the next quarter-century. The competition is set to feature 18 countries in the November 18-24 finals in Madrid next year, and will replace the classic home-and-away ties played four times per year for decades. Kosmos is headed by Barcelona footballer Gerard Pique, who is hoping fellow Spaniard Rafael Nadal will play in the upcoming event. Novak Djokovic has said he will give precedence to the ATP\\x92s intended re-launch of the defunct World Team Cup in January 2020, at various Australian venues. Major players feel that a big event in late November combined with one in January before the Australian Open will mean too much tennis and too little rest. Federer said earlier this month in Shanghai in that his chances of playing the Davis Cup were all but non-existent. \\x93I highly doubt it, of course. We\\x92ll see what happens,\\x94 he said. \\x93I don\\x92t think this was designed for me, anyhow. This was designed for the future generation of players.\\x94 Argentina and Britain received wild cards to the new-look event, and will compete along with the four 2018 semi-finalists and the 12 teams who win qualifying rounds next February. \\x93I don\\x92t like being under that kind of pressure,\\x94 Federer said of the deadline Kosmos handed him.'"
